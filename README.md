# Project-2

-For the ETL mini project, I built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, I created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

-Highlights of work Done:  

- Extract and transform the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a category DataFrame, and export the category DataFrame as category.csv and save it to your GitHub repository

- Extract and transform the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a subcategory DataFrame, and export the subcategory DataFrame as subcategory.csv and save it to your GitHub repository.

- Continue this process creating a campaign and contacts Dataframe and saving it to Github repository

- Finally, create the Crowdfunding Database in PostgreSQL by sketching an Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) in QUICKDBD. Use this information to create a table schema for each of the 4 CSV files, in the correct order to handle the primary/foreign keys. Verify this once completed.
